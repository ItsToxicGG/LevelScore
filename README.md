If you want any other LevelSystem plugin supporting scorehud then say it at issues tab
And it could be public or private

If public send it or send the github or poggit link

If private send it to me if you don't trust me, then send the plugin name and find the code which holds getLevel, getXp, addXp, etc. And then send that code to me I'll do it
